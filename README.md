#### The Question

This project sets out to explore the question **üå¶Ô∏è "Is London really as rainy as the movies make it out to be?" üå¶Ô∏è**.  
To answer this, London will be compared against 10 other cities, including 5 European cities for regional context, over two distinct 10-year periods. This approach allows the assessment of any historical changes in rainfall patterns.

The analysis will focus on multiple aspects of rainfall, including:

- Mean Daily and Annual Rainfall: To evaluate the overall volume of rain each city experiences.
- Cumulative Rainfall: To track how rainfall accumulates over time, providing insight into the long-term trends for each city.
- Precipitation Hours: To examine the frequency of rainfall, contributing to our understanding of how often it rains in London compared to other cities.

By combining these factors, the project aims to offer a comprehensive assessment of London's raininess, accounting for both the volume of rain and the frequency of precipitation, and determining whether the city's reputation for frequent rain is deserved.
